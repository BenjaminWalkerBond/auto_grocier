The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. It‚Äôs perfect for a quick midweek meal but even better if you can simmer it for a couple of hours! Serve it over pasta, stuff into jacket potatoes, make an epic Lasagna or Baked Spaghetti Pie! This is a reader-favourite recipe included by popular demand in my debut cookbook ‚ÄúDinner‚Äù! Spaghetti Bolognese We Aussies have a thing about shortening words. Good day is g‚Äôday. Pavlova is Pav, afternoon is arvo, mosquitos are mozzies. Sharon is Shazz, Nagisa is Nagi (that‚Äôs yours truly). So it is thoroughly Aussie to shorten Spaghetti Bolognese to Spag Bol! And here she is ‚Äì my Spag Bol. Rich, thick, incredible flavour in the sauce even if you only have time for a quick 20 minute simmer. Though if you can slow cook for a couple of hours, it really takes it to another level! What goes in Spaghetti Bolognese I‚Äôve been loyal to this Meat Sauce recipe since I first learned to cook when I was a teenager. There are 3 little things in this recipe that might be a bit different to Bolognese recipes you‚Äôve seen around: 1. Worcestershire sauce: it just adds that little extra something-something. I get antsy if I get caught in a situation where I have to do without; 2. Beef bouillon cubes (beef stock cubes) for extra depth of flavour in the sauce, to compensate for this being an everyday midweek version rather than a traditional slow cooked Bolognese Ragu which starts with a soffrito (onion, celery, carrot slowly saut√©ed) as well as pancetta. 3. Sugar, if needed: just a little bit goes a long way to transform the sauce if you happen not to be using high quality, sweet Italian canned tomatoes. Supermarket canned tomatoes here in Australia are notoriously sour. Especially the Australian ones ‚Äì it pains me so much to say that, but it‚Äôs true. How to make Bolognese Sauce The making part is straightforward and quite quick too: Saute garlic and onion ‚Äì about 3 minutes;Brown the beef ‚Äì about 2 minutes;Add everything else, give it a good stir then simmer for 20 minutes minimum (midweek), up to 3 hours (weekend indulgence!). Slow cooking makes the beef incredibly tender and the sauce develops extra flavour. Difference between Bolognese and Meat Sauce? Different name for the same thing! You‚Äôll find Bolognese made all sorts of ways all across Italy and all around the world, but essentially mince meat (usually beef, sometimes combined with pork or veal) in a tomato based sauce flavoured with herbs. The ‚Äúproper‚Äù way to serve pasta: toss with the sauce As with all my pasta recipes, I include a step to toss the pasta IN the sauce, rather than just placing pasta in bowls and spooning over sauce. This makes the Bolognese sauce emulsify, so it thickens, becomes glossy and clings to the spaghetti. No more watery sauce at the bottom of your pasta bowl! This is how chefs and Italians make pasta. Try it once, you will be converted! But it is an optional step. Sometimes, you just don‚Äôt have the energy to clean yet another pan. I hear ya. üôÇ What to serve with Spaghetti Bolognese For a classic Italian feast, serve this with: Garlic Bread ‚Äì or even more indulgent, with Cheesy Garlic Bread (or go over-the-top with Crack Bread). Or, for a more traditional start, real-deal Italian Focaccia.Garden Salad with Italian Dressing (hit of crisp fresh salad essential!)Tiramisu to finish with an Espresso Martini on the side For a super quick side salad option, make this Rocket Parmesan Salad with Balsamic Dressing. Probably my most made side salad because it‚Äôs literally a 2 minute effortless-no-chop salad! This recipe is the way I have been making Spaghetti Bolognese for decades (gosh it‚Äôs scary saying that!!). I really love it, and I think the sauce is rich and loaded with flavour, especially for a 30 minute Bolognese recipe. Though if you have the time, slow cook it for a couple of hours. The flavour develops and the meat becomes so luxuriously tender. Either way, I hope you love it as much as I do! ‚Äì Nagi xx Watch how to make it This recipe features in my debut cookbook Dinner.

My everyday Bolognese recipe I make over and over again. This Meat Sauce has terrific depth of flavour for such a quick recipe ‚Äì though if you have the time, it's stellar cooked slowly for a couple of hours. My 3 "secret" tips are: Worcestershire Sauce, Beef Bouillon Cubes and a touch of sugar. Ingredients‚ñ¢ 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil‚ñ¢ 2 garlic cloves , minced‚ñ¢ 1 onion , finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)‚ñ¢ 1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef) OR half pork, half beef (Note 1)‚ñ¢ 1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine (sub water or beef broth/stock)‚ñ¢ 2 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled OR granulated beef bouillon (Note 2)‚ñ¢ 800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato (or tomato passata)‚ñ¢ 2 tbsp tomato paste‚ñ¢ 2 tsp white sugar , if needed (Note 3)‚ñ¢ 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce‚ñ¢ 2 dried bay leaves‚ñ¢ 2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)‚ñ¢ Salt and pepperTo Serve‚ñ¢ 400 g / 13 oz spaghetti , dried‚ñ¢ Parmesan cheese and finely chopped parsley (optional) InstructionsHeat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 ‚Äì 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally. Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 ‚Äì 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti ‚Äì though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.Tossing Sauce and Spaghetti (optional, Note 4)Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.Scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water and set aside, then drain the pasta.Add pasta into the bolognese sauce with about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved pasta water over medium heat. Toss gently for 1 1/2 ‚Äì 2 minutes, or until the spaghetti turns red and the sauce thickens.Divide between bowls. Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired. Recipe Notes:1. Meat ‚Äì Some traditional slow cooked Bolognese Sauce are made with a mixture of beef and pork mince. Beef for flavour, pork for juiciness. I typically do not use this for midweek. 2. Beef stock cubes ‚Äì I use Oxo Beef Cubes (Woolies & Coles). Use any beef bouillon / stock cube or in powder form (called ‚Äúgranulated beef bouillon‚Äù in some countries). If using a powder, use 2 tsp (ie 1 tsp per 1 cube). 3. Canned tomato ‚Äì Mid range canned tomato can be notoriously sour. A touch of sugar makes an incredible difference. The amount required will depend on how sweet / sour the tomatoes and tomato paste is ‚Äì go by taste. Typically, the better the quality, the less sour they are so the less sugar you will need. 4. Tossing pasta sauce ‚Äì See commentary in post about emulsifying the pasta sauce. This is the ‚Äúproper‚Äù Italian way to cook pastas, and the way pasta is served in restaurants. 5. Slow simmer option ‚Äì this is how you take a great bolognese to an incredible one that would make your Italian Nonna proud. The key here is ultra low heat ‚Äì after bringing to simmer, lower heat so the surface is just gently rippling, with a few bubbles here and there. Once the lid has been on for a while, take a peek to check ‚Äì because it gets hotter with the lid on. I use my smallest burner on the lowest setting. 6. Other notes:* Scaling recipe up (use auto recipe scaler) ‚Äì If you double the recipe (or more!), then brown the beef in batches. If you try to cook it in one batch, you will end up stewing it rather than browning!* Slow cooker: This is really fantastic made in a slow cooker! The meat becomes so tender and the sauce has incredible flavour. At step 3, cook until the wine liquid disappears completely, then transfer it into the slow cooker at step 4 and cook for low for 6 hours. * Variations: Here are some ideas for ways to take this up a notch, if you are so inclined!‚Äì Finely chop 1 carrot + celery and saute that with the onion to make a softrito. Cook on medium low heat for 10 minutes for extra amazingness!‚Äì Add finely chopped bacon (smokey is the ultimate!) or pancetta, cook with the onion‚Äì 1 tbsp soy sauce (my mother did this, I sometimes do! I‚Äôve seen it in some chef recipes)‚Äì Fresh or dried red chilli‚Äì Bolognese gets better the longer it is cooked, and it‚Äôs even better the next day! 7.

Reply Belinda Loftus says June 9, 2023 at 9:53 pm Thank you Nagi. I make this recipe every few months and keep in little ice block size pieces ready to go in the freezer for in case of emergencies at home. I add celery and onions (softrito) at the start and also zucchini while I am slow cooking for extra veggies. Tonight cooked 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef mince to mix it up ‚Äì delicious! Reply Ron says June 6, 2023 at 3:18 am Ok so I did the short time version of this,,,,an man I can‚Äôt wait to do the long version‚Ä¶.cuz it was bombing‚Ä¶(Good!!) thank you‚Ä¶. üôÇ Reply Susan says May 24, 2023 at 9:13 am I‚Äôve tried so many times to duplicate my mother‚Äôs spaghetti and have failed miserably. This tastes exactly like hers did! Used beef broth option sub for wine and didn‚Äôt have bouillon. The sauce literally did stick to the GF Jovial spaghetti. Simmered it in the oven for 1 1/2 hrs (added water as needed) and it is absolutely the best. Thank you! Reply Zara says May 24, 2023 at 12:09 am The recipe is pure perfection. I would 100% suggest the slow-simmer option- definitely takes it to another level! I make this at least 4 times a month (i do sub wine for broth). SO GOOD! Reply Trish says May 23, 2023 at 12:04 am Absolutely divine! I simmered mine for a few hours, and it was worth waiting! My family loved it! Reply Denise says May 20, 2023 at 2:37 pm My son loves the bolognaise from our local Italian restaurant, but none of the recipes we‚Äôd tried at home had won him over‚Ä¶ until this one. His eye lit up when he tasted it! I‚Äôm vegetarian so had never been able to figure out by taste-testing what the other recipes were missing‚Ä¶ but whatever it is, this one is a hit at our house. As always, thank you for the helpful notes and tips ‚Äì your recipes are so well written, you should write a guide to recipe-writing üôÇ Reply Florence Hollinghead says May 16, 2023 at 8:44 am This is excellent and easy to make. Will be making this on a regular basis. Reply Anna says May 1, 2023 at 9:30 pm Sorry, bit confused about the directions! Do you follow step 4, THEN 5? Or do you choose between step 4 and 5? And if it‚Äôs the latter and you choose step 4, do you go from there to step 6? Reply Lara Liv says April 15, 2023 at 3:56 am Stroganoff is a family fav. Usually I buy a cut of lean meat and after adding most ind. leave to simmer for 4 hrs. or until meat falls apart. In earlier days I used more meat and less veg and mushrooms. Was del. however we have changed course and now use loads more mushrooms than meat and it is sooo good. Just one more thing, we prefer a more reddish color to our Stroganoff and lots of fresh cream üôÇ Thanks for all your wonderful recipies, each make my day üôÇ Reply linda frizzi says April 13, 2023 at 12:23 pm I‚Äôm looking forward to making this but I was wondering if you have ‚ÄúBETTER THAN BOUILLON‚Äù down under? For years they just had beef, chicken & vegetable but recently they came out with more offerings. Once I discovered better than bouillon I gave up cubes for ever! https://www.betterthanbouillon.com/ Reply Mark Forde says April 4, 2023 at 4:23 am Hi Nagi. Before I mention this, I have been using your recipes for years now with supreme success. I just want to point out that OXO cube (normal salt) in Ireland and Europe is 190 ml of prepared stock. Perfect for this recipe. Everything elso chicken, vegetable and beef stock cube (not OXO) is 450 mls of prepared stock per individual cube. So anything in Europe would end up extremely salty if you used a beef stock cube that wasn‚Äôt OXO. And extremely unhealthy salt wise. I know you are fastidious when it comes to different areas and measures. So thought I‚Äôd mention this. An OXO cube had less than 2 grams of salt. Our beef stock cubes in general has about 4.5 grams. Same with chicken and vegetables. Unless you get the leas salt version, but they still make 450 ml of stock to our OXO that‚Äôs 190, less salt or not. Reply Wendy cole says May 3, 2023 at 9:36 pm I agree Mark, used knorr in a recipe from tin eats chicken noodle soup and was very salty tried it again with oxo and was perfect Reply Lara Liv says April 15, 2023 at 4:11 am Is this an ad for Oxo ? You know that studies have shown that earlier studies regarding daily salt intake have been proven not so reliable and actually fit adults should at least intake 2 gr. ‚Äì 6gr. of salt daily. Reply Dawn Metcalf says April 1, 2023 at 6:39 am Wow! First time making sauce from scratch. I appreciated every note and committed them to memory. All your tips to elevate the sauce is exactly what I was missing with other recipes‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt find a way to make my sauce a ‚Äúwow‚Äù and this did it. Thank you so much and PLEASE continue, we are becoming better cooks with your instructions and help! Reply Natalie says March 29, 2023 at 5:19 pm I‚Äôve made this twice now. About to make it for a third time. The easiest yet most delicious spag bol recipe I‚Äôve come across. Thanks. üôÇ Reply Sarah S. says March 28, 2023 at 11:15 pm Long time reader, first time commenter: Made last night for my 15 year old‚Äôs b-day dinner. Slow simmer is the wayüíô Big hit. Love a low effort, maximum impact recipe. On another note, pre-ordered my cookbook here in the States and should have it in hand today ‚Äì can‚Äôt wait! Love how perfectly organized your recipes are Nagi. Reply Rachel says February 26, 2023 at 2:03 am Perfect recipe! Reply Jon Collin says February 23, 2023 at 11:13 pm Hi Nagi, love this recipe it‚Äôs always turned out great especially when slow cooking. This time around I didn‚Äôt have any brown onions left so used a red one instead, will that cause any differences to the taste / outcome? P.S. Looking forward to getting your book when it‚Äôs released in the UK üôÇ Reply Polly says February 21, 2023 at 7:46 pm Winner Nagi, I did add powdered mushroom and evap milk for extra richness, it didnt need it but I had them to use, delish. Reply Lauren says February 15, 2023 at 9:55 am This Spag Bol is delicious and was a winner for the kids. Made this last week and am making it again tonight demanded by the kids. Reply Fiona says February 12, 2023 at 10:18 am Excellent tasty spag bol. Enhanced it with the suggested soy sauce, pancetta, sofrito and chilli & also added a large punnet of chestnut sliced mushrooms. Thanks a million for including several ways to cook always! I chose slow cook 2.5hrs as opposed to slow cooker cook of 6 hours. Reply Older CommentsPrimary SidebarSearch Recipes... Hi, I'm Nagi!
